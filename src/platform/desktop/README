Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running interactive PyMite on the
desktop.  Any POSIX-compliant OS should work (Mac OS X, Linux, Cygwin).


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean PyMite tree.  Build the PyMite VM archive as well as the 
sample application::

    $ cd src/platform/desktop
    $ make


Read ``docs/src/InteractivePyMite.txt`` to learn how to run ipm.
