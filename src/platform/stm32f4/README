The STM32F4 discovery Platform Project
==========================


:Author:    James Snyder

:STM32F4discovery port:  H.I.

Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running interactive PyMite (ipm)
on the `STM32F4-discovery`_, which is an STM32F4 processor on a stamp-type
board.  The STM32F407 has an ARM Cortex M4f core.

.. _`STM32F4-discovery: Discovery kit for STM32 F4 series`: http://www.st.com/stm32f4-discovery


Requirements
------------

ARM EABI GCC toolchains

Building the Project
--------------------

:Note: This platform does not have Makefile build support.

Now use scons to build the project::

    $ cd pymite-09
    $ scons PLATFORM=stm32f4

Now load the following file into your target's flash:
``src/platform/stm32f4/main.bin``
